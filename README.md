I developed a personal portfolio website that showcases my skills, projects, and achievements, designed with a focus on responsiveness and accessibility. The portfolio is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a clean and structured layout. I utilized CSS for advanced styling techniques, including media queries, to ensure the design adapts seamlessly across various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops. JavaScript adds dynamic interactions, enhancing the user experience with smooth animations and navigation. The site serves as a professional platform to highlight my expertise and projects in an intuitive and visually appealing manner.
